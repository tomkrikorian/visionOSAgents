# visionOS AGENTS & Skills

This repository provides an **AGENTS.MD** and **Skills definitions** designed to be used with **Cursor** and/or **OpenAI Codex**, with a **primary focus on visionOS and spatial computing development**.

It is intended for developers building applications for **Apple Vision Pro**, leveraging Swift, SwiftUI, RealityKit, and visionOS-specific APIs. The goal is to offer a structured, AI-friendly knowledge base that accelerates development while staying aligned with Apple’s platform conventions and best practices.
